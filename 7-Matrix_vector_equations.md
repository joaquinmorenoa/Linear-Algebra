Theorem:
Let A be an m*n matrix. Then the following statements are logically equivalent:
  - for each 'b' in R^m, the equation Ax = b has a solution.
  - each 'b'b in R^m is a linear combinatioin of the columns of A.
  - the columns of A span R^m.
  - the matrix A has a pivot in every row.
  
The Row-Vector Rule, to solve Ax.
