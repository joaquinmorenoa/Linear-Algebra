Span:

The span of set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. Let V be a vector space and let S  =  {v1, v2, ... , vn) be a subset of V.  We say that S spans V if every vector v in V can be written as a linear combination of vectors in S.
  - v  =  c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + cnvn  
  - Span{v1, v2, ..., vk} = Rn ⇒ k ≥ n
