# Vector Spaces

A real vector space is nonempty set of V of objects called vectors in which two operations, addition and multiplication by scalars are defined where the following axioms are true.

The axioms must hold for all u, v and w in V and for all scalars c and d.

  - Associativity of addition 	
  
  ```u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w```
  
  - Commutativity of addition 	
  
  ```u + v = v + u```
  
  - Identity element of addition 	
  
  ```There exists an element 0 ∈ V, called the zero vector, such that v + 0 = v for all v ∈ V.```
  
  - Inverse elements of addition 	
  
  ```For every v ∈ V, there exists an element −v ∈ V, called the additive inverse of v, such that v + (−v) = 0.```
  
  - Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication 	
  
  ```a(bv) = (ab)v^[nb 2]```
  
  - Identity element of scalar multiplication 	
  
  ```1v = v, where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity in F.```
  
  - Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition   	
  
  ```a(u + v) = au + av```
  
  - Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition 
  
  ```(a + b)v = av + bv```
