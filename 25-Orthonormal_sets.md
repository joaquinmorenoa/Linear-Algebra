# Orthonormal sets

A set of vectors {u1,u2,u3...up} in R^n is an orthogonal set if eac pair of distinct vectors from the set is orthogonal, that is ui.uj = 0,  for all i not equals j and ui.ui = 1.

### Theorem

An mxn matrix U has orthonormal coloumns if and only if (U^T)(U) = I

### Theorem

Let U be an mxn matrix with orthogonal coloumns and x and y be in R^n
   - ||Ux|| = ||x||
   - (Ux).(Uy) = x.y
   - (Ux).(Uy) = 0 iff x.y = 0
