 Algebraic Properties of Vectors

    Commutative (vector) P + Q = Q + P
    Associative (vector) (P + Q) + R = P + (Q + R)
    Additive identity There is a vector 0 such that (P + 0) = P = (0 + P) for all P
    Additive inverse For any P there is a vector -P such that P + (-P) = 0
    Distributive (vector) r(P + Q) = rP + rQ
    Distributive (scalar) (r + s) P = rP + sP
    Associative (scalar) r(sP) = (rs)P
    Multiplicative identity For the real number 1,
    1P = P for each P
