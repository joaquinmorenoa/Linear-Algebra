# Characteristic Equation

The polynomial det(A-cI) is called the characteristic polynomial of A.

The equation det(A-cI)=0 is the characteristic equation.

The solutin to the characteristic equation are hte eigenvalues of A.

### Definition

Given two nxn matrices A and B, we day that A is similar to B if there exists ab invertible matrix P with B = (P^-1)(A)(P).
```
B = (P^-1)(A)(P)
```

### Theorem

If A is similar to B, then A and B have the same characteristic polynomial and hence the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicies.
