# Diagonalizable Marix

### Definition 

A square matrix D is diagonal if the only non zero entries in D are on the diagonal of D.
```
A^k = (P)(D^k)(P^-1)
```

### Theorem

An nxn matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if A has n linearly independent eigenvectors.

IN fact, A=(P)(D^k)(P^-1) with D diagonal, if and only if the coloumns of P are n linearly independent eigenvectors of A. In this case, the diagonal entries of D are he eigenvalues of A that corresponds, respectively, to he eigenvectors in P.
