# Diagonalization of symmetric matrices

### Eigenvectors of symmetric matrices

##### Theorem

If A is symmetric, then any two eigenvectors of A from different eigenspaces are orthogonal.

##### Theorem

An nxn matrix A is orthogonally diagonalizible iff A is symmetric.

### Spectral Theorem for Symmetric Matrices

An nxn Symmetric matrix A has the following properties:
  - A has n real egenvalues, counting multiplicities
  - Th edimension of the eigenspaces for each eigenvalues c equals the multiplicity c as asroot of the characteristic equation
  - The eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal
  - A is orthogonally diagonalizible
