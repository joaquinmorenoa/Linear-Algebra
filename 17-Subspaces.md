# Subspaces

Let K be a field (such as the real numbers), V be a vector space over K, and let W be a subset of V. Then W is a subspace if:
  - The zero vector, 0, is in W.
  - If u and v are elements of W, then the sum u + v is an element of W.
  - If u is an element of W and c is a scalar from K, then the scalar product cu is an element of W.
