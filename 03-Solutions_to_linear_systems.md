# Describing solutions

### In the Echelon form,
 - if there is a pivot in the last column, then the system is inconsistent (has no solution)
 - if a liner system is consistent, then the solution set contains either 
   - a unique solution (if there are no free variables)
   - Infinitely many solutions (if there are one or more free variables)
