# Charaterisation of Linearly Dependent Sets
  - A set of two vectors {v,u} is linearly dependent if one of the vectors is a multiple of the other.
  - A set of two vectors {v,u} is linearly independent if neither vector is a multiple of the other.
  
  ### Theorem
  An indexed set of S of two or more vectors is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors in S is alinear combination of others.
  
  In fact, if S is linearly dependent and v1 is not equal to zero, where v1 is first vector, then some v(j) (with j>1) is a linear combination of the preceding vectors v1,v2,v3...,vj-1.
  
  ### Theorem
  If a set cpntains more than there are entries in each vector, then the set is linearly dependent.
  
  That is, any set {v1,v2,v3..vp} in R^n is linearly dependent is p>n.
  
  ### Theorem
  if a set S in R^n contains a zero vector, then S is linearly dependent.
