# Basis

Let H be a subspace of a vector V. An indexed set of vectors B = {b1,b2,b3...bp} in V is a basis for H if 
  - The set B is linearly independent
  - The set B spans H, thats is Span{b1,b2,b3...bp} = H
 
### Standard Basis

The vectors e1,e2,,,en that are the coloumns of the nxn identity matrix form a basis for R^n.

The set {e1,e2,e3...en} is called the standard basis.

### Spanning Set Theorem

Let S = {v1,v2..vp} be a set in a vector space V, and let H = Span{v1,v2...vp}
  - If one of the vectors in S is a linear combination of the other, then the set obtained by removing htis vector from S stil spans H.
  - if H not equals zer0, then some subsets S is a basis for H.
