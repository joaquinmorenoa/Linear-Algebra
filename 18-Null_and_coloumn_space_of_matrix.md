# Null Space of Matrix

Let A be an mxn matrix. Then the null spcace of A, written Nul A, is the set of all vectors x belonging to R^n such that Ax = 0

Equivalently, if T: R^n -> R^m is linear transformation with associated matrix A, then Nul A is the set of all vectors x belonging to R^n such that T(x)=0.

### Theorem

Given an mxn matrix A, the set Nul A is a subspace of R^n.

### Describing Nul A

The NUll space of A is defined implicitely, becasue it is defined by the condition that has to be checked.

There is no obviuos way to generate elements of Nul A just from the definition.

### Finding Spanning Set of Nul A

To descrikbe Nul A, we solve for the equation Ax=0.

A spanning set of Nul A contains one vector for each free variable in this equation.

# Coloumn Space of Matrix

Given an mxn matrix, the coloumn space of A is another related subspace.

We define coloumn space and compare and contrast the coloum sopace to the null space.\

If the coloumns are a1,a2,a3,a3..an then coloumn space of A is written as Col A is span{a1,a2,a3...an}.

So Col A is the subspace of R^m containing all linear combinations of coloumns of A.

# Kernel and Image

Let V and W be the vector spaces, and let T be the linear transforamtion T: V -> W.

The kernel (null space) of T is the set of all v blonging to V such that T(v) = 0.

The image (range) of T is the set of all w belonigng to W of the form T(x) for some x belonging to V.
