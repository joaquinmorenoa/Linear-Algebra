# Gram Schmidt Process

Given a subspca W of R^n, we would like to fin an orthogonal or orthonormal basis of W.

The Gram Schmidt process allows to start with any basis for W and construct a new basis that is orthogonal or orthonormal.

If an orthonormal basis is desired, then we first use GS to find orthogonal basis. Then w normalise eaxh evector to obtain an orthonormal basis.
