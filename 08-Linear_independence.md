# Linear Independence

A set of vctors is sai to be linearly independent if the vector equation only has trivial solution, where trivial solution means substituting all the linear coefficients to zero.

# Dependence Relation: 

A set of vctors is sai to be linearly dependent if the vector equation only non trivial solution, where trivial solution means substituting all the linear coefficients to zero.
n vectors X_1, X_2, ..., X_n are linearly dependent iff there exist scalars c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, not all zero.
