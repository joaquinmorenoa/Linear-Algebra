# Null Spaec of Matrix

Let A be an mxn matrix. Then the null spcace of A, written Nul A, is the set of all vectors x belonging to R^n such that Ax = 0

Equivalently, if T: R^n -> R^m is linear transformation with associated matrix A, then Nul A is the set of all vectors x belonging to R^n such that T(x)=0.

### Theorem

Given an mxn matrix A, the set Nul A is a subspace of R^n.

### Describing Nul A

The NUll space of A is defined implicitely, becasue it is defined by the condition that has to be checked.

There is no obviuos way to generate elements of Nul A just from the definition.

### Finding Spanning Set of Nul A

To descrikbe Nul A, we solve for the equation Ax=0.

A spanning set of Nul A contains one vector for each free variable in this equation.
