Non Homogeneous Linear Equation

Theorem: Suppose the equation Ax=b is consistent for some gioiven b, and let p be the solution. Then the solution set of Ax=b is the set of all vectors of the form w=p+v, where v is a solution of the homogeneous equation Ax=0.

Proving the theorem:
  - Any vector of the form p+v is a solution to Ax=b
    A(p+v) = Ap + Av = b+0 = b
  - Every solution to Ax=b has the form p+v
    Let w be a solution to Ax=b, now w-p is a solution to homogeneousequation Ax=0
    A(w-p) = Aw - Ap = b-b = 0

Note, the theorem applies only when:
  - the homogeneous equation Ax=0 aways has at least one solution (x=0)
  - the non homoegneous equation Ax=b might not be consistent, of it has a solution then only the theorem applies.
