  - A system  of linear equations is homogeneous if it can be written in the form Ax = 0 for some matrix A.
  - In this case, all of the linear equations in the system will be set equal to zero.
  - Zero vector will always be the solution.
  
Solutions as Spans:
  - in general, we will always be able to write the solution sets of the homogeneous system as the span of some of vectors.
  - There will be one vector for each free variable.
