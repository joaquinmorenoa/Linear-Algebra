Elementary Matrix Operations

There are three kinds of elementary matrix operations:
 - Interchange two rows (or columns).
 - Multiply each element in a row (or column) by a non-zero number.
 - Multiply a row (or column) by a non-zero number and add the result to another row (or column).
 
Row operations:
 - Interchange rows i and j 	Ri <--> Rj
 - Multiply row i by s, where s ≠ 0 	sRi --> Ri
 - Add s times row i to row j 	sRi + Rj --> Rj
 
Column operations:
 - Interchange columns i and j 	Ci <--> Cj
 - Multiply column i by s, where s ≠ 0 	sCi --> Ci
 - Add s times column i to column j 	sCi + Cj --> Cj
